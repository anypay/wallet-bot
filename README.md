# Wallet Bot

Self-custody, headless wallet service that runs as a daemon process within your data center. It manages your software operation's private keys so that your apps can securely send payments on any peer to peer payments network.

## Installation and Setup

The application runs as a long-running process which should be managed by k8s, docker, or your system service manager such as systemd or similar. It may be run in a node.js environment or as an isolated docker container. The single process requires no additional services such as database servers to be run.


`docker pull anypay/wallet-bot`

## Setting Up Wallet Bot Keys


#### Wallet Private Key Seed Phrase

All of your coins shall be controlled by a single bip39 seed phrase
```
echo wallet_bot_backup_seed_phrase=$(docker run anypay/wallet-bot npx seed-phrase) >> .env
```

#### Anypay Access Token
Get your wallet bot access token here: [https://anypayx.com/apps/wallet-bot/](https://anypayx.com/apps/wallet-bot/)

```
# Replace with your own access token
export token=58e3b95f-da61-4230-9d78-40f395fee7dd 

echo anypay_access_token=$token >> .env
```

#### Run with Docker

Once your .env file contains the required variables you may start wallet bot:
