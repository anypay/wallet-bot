# Wallet Bot

Self-custody, headless wallet service that runs as a daemon process within your data center. It manages your software operation's private keys so that your apps can securely send payments on any peer to peer payments network.

## Installation and Setup

The application runs as a long-running process which should be managed by k8s, docker, or your system service manager such as systemd or similar. It may be run in a node.js environment or as an isolated docker container. The single process requires no additional services such as database servers to be run.


`docker pull anypay/wallet-bot`

## Setting Up Wallet Bot Keys


#### Wallet Private Key Seed Phrase

All of your coins shall be controlled by a single bip39 seed phrase
```
echo wallet_bot_backup_seed_phrase=$(docker run anypay/wallet-bot npx seed-phrase) >> .env
```
