/** 
 * # USD Coin (Avalanche ERC-20) (USDC)
 *
 * USD Coin is astablecoin brought to you by Circle and Coinbase. It is issued by regulated and licensed financial institutions that maintain full reserves of the equivalent fiat currency.
 *
 * Avalanche is an eco-friendly, decentralized smart contracts platform driving some of the most important projects across DeFi and NFTs. Since launching in September 2020, Avalanche has become one of the fastest-growing ecosystems in crypto, with more than 350 projects, 1,100 separate block-producing validators and over one million community members. Avalanche is compatible with Ethereum smart contracts and tooling, which enables Ethereum users and developers to quickly access and launch high-performance decentralized apps. Transactions on Avalanche are executed with low fees and near-instant finality. During the UNâ€™s COP26 conference in November 2021, Avalanche announced it has become a net-zero carbon output blockchain, heralding a new era of sustainability in the blockchain ecosystem.
